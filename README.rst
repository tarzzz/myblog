===============================================


A blogging framework which utilizes Django's Admin Interface to create rich content and quickly publish it on web.
It is built in such a way that it can be directly installed on a server and provides a ready-to-use blog.

Things to come soon:

  - One step installation to remote machines.
  - Custom themes which can be managed from admin interface.
  - Custom themes per article.
  - Pluggable email subscription modals and social buttons.
  - Cron database backups: So that your content and customizations are never lost during database/server migrations.


Installation:

WIP - Stay tuned for updates.
